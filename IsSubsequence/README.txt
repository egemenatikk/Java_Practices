This program takes two strings and decides if the first string is a subsequence of the second string or not.
Being a subsequence of another string means that the letters of the first string takes place in the second string as well, sequentially.

Example input and outputs:
 
INPUT 1: "", "word"				OUTPUT 1: true
INPUT 2: "asdfg", "asctrfg"		OUTPUT 2: false
INPUT 3: "can", "chameleon" 		OUTPUT 3: true
INPUT 4: "", ""					OUTPUT 4: true
