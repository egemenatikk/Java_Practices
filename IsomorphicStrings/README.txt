This program takes two strings and decide if they are isomorphic. Isomorphic strings mean that you can convert one another by changing the letters of them. 
You have to match letters one-to-one. 

For example: "call" and "ring". You map c->r, a->i, l->n. You cannot map l->g, so these two words are not isomorphic.

Example input and outputs:

INPUT 1: "call", "ring"    				OUTPUT 1: false
NPUT 2: "", ""            				OUTPUT 2: true
INPUT 3: "technique", "expertise"		OUTPUT 3: false
